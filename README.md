# iPassenger

We are a team of undergraduates from Sri Lanka who envision to improve the standards of public transportation immensely, through reducing the wait time for both the public transportation mode and the passenger. At the same time, we intend to make a contribution in reducing congestion in and around the main cities, saving many productive man hours spent on maneuvering through traffic. 

Buses are the main form of public transportation within the country. We have identified a common problem people face with regards to public transport. In urban areas due to lack of usage of public transportation congestion on roads has increased. Similarly in rural areas, the buses are few and far between. Providing a calculation of the estimated arrival time of a bus will be useful in reducing the time people spend  waiting at bus stations for a bus to arrive, especially the unpopular bus routes. It also ensures that the buses do not need to spend a lot of time at the bus station for the vehicle to fill up, which in turn would keep traffic moving in the bus lanes. 

Therefore, with the thought of improving public transport and societal well being, we theorized building an app which locates buses. As an initiative we developed ‘iPassenger’ which is an android application where passengers can locate buses of a particular route. This is an  application which provide interfaces for both the passenger and the driver at the same time rather than two separate applications serving the two types of users. 

This is an idea that has not been implemented in the country up to now. At the moment we have added the following functionalities to the application with the intention of improving them in the near future.
